Set yourself up with ell first. This allows you to use the new way of function calling or prompt as programming. It is easier than langchain and easier to look at.

Install your arduino code so that you can control 4 motors

Then install your esp code like I have provided to control those motors. 

Test with a webpage interface I use 192.168.0.208

Then run the python script, you will need an api key in your envrionment variables to make the code run with openai or you can modify to use local AI.
Examples of this are in the ell project
